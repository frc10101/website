## 📝 Development Notes

### Adding Images
Replace the image placeholders in the HTML with actual images:
1. Add image files to the `images/` folder
2. Update the HTML to reference the actual image paths
3. Consider using the lazy loading data attributes for performance

### Extending Functionality
The JavaScript is modular and easy to extend:
- Add new form handlers in `main.js`
- Create additional animations using the Intersection Observer pattern
- Extend the notification system for different message types

### Performance Optimization
- Images use lazy loading (when implemented)
- CSS and JS are minified for production
- Modern CSS features reduce JavaScript dependencies
